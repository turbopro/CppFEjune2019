HW: Level 9, Groups C&D: Monte Carlo Pricing Methods

C. Monte Carlo 101



1.	In order to make the program perhaps a little more readable, the OptionData struct,
the SDEDefinition namespace definition, and all function declaraions and definitions
have been placed into the 'OptionData.hpp' header file.


i.	struct OptionData :

Includes nine (9) data members to build OptionData objects: Four standard option
parameters, K, T, r, and sig, plus five extra parameters particular to the MC simulation
requirements, H, D, betaCEV, scale, and type. In addition, the myPayOffFunction
returns the payoff based on the simulation price after a run.


ii	SDEDefinition namespace

Namespace definition to hold together a pointer to an OptionData object and the 
associated SDE functions to be used for the various models in the simulations.


iii	SumSquaresAndSum

Template function to calculate and return the sum of, and the sum of the squares of,
the elements of a container 


iv	StandardDeviationAndError

Template function to calculate and return the Standard dEviation and Standard Error
for the simulated prices returned after a run. Makes use of the SumSquaresAndSum
function.


v.	print

Utility function to print the elements of a vector.



2.	TestMC.cpp

i.	In the main TestMC.cpp file, Range.hpp and Range.cpp are included to allow the use
of the mesh function. The mesh function creates a mesh of the T parameter of the
OptionData object for the simulation run.

ii.	Firstly, create an OptionData object based on a list of Option parameters. Also,
create/set a variable with the 'exact' price associated with that list of option parameters.

iii.	In the simulation run, we create a random number, dW, which makes use of the 
NormalGenerator and BoostNormal functions. NormalGenerator.hpp provides for these
functions.  A std::unique_ptr of type NormalGenerator (BoosNormal) is created on 
the heap and used to generate dW during the simulation runs.  The std::unique_ptr
manages the heap memory efficiently without the need for the delete function.

iv.	Template functions SumSquaresAndSum and StandardDeviationAndError, defined in the
OptionData.hpp header file, calculate the SD and SE for a simulation run. SD and SE will 
help determine the accuracy of the simulation to caclulate a price that best approximates
the 'exact' price.


v.	In the main function:
	
-	create an OptionData struct object
-	set the initial price of the asset
-	set the target 'exact' price
-	create time steps and simulation vectors
-	create a vector of tuple to hold the details and results of the simulation runs
-	Create/initialise a variable to hold the simulation price
-	Create/initialise a variable for the random variable
-	Create/initialise variables for the simulation runs
-	Create/initialise the SDE data variable
-	Create a vector of double to hold simulated prices

-	Set outer for loop controlled by the set of defined time steps
-	Includes an inner for loop controlled by the set of defined simulations values
	-	Set the range for and create the time steps mesh
	-	Create/Set the relevant T step variable for use in the calculations
	-	Create/Set the count variable to track spurious values
	-	Inner loop controlled by the number of simulations
		-	Create a random number
		-	Calculate the new price based on the current price
		-	Set the current price to the new price
		-	Check and set the count variable 
	-	Calculate the average price from the simulation run
	-	Add the calculated price to the vector of prices
	-	Reset the simulation price variables 
-	Calculate the discounted price
-	Calculate SD and SE
-	Collect caculated values and simulation values
-	Reset simulation values 
-	Display the resulting values from the simulation runs
